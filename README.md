## Introduction

No more propping your eyes open with matchsticks to try and catch Santa! This Scratch program uses a low cost infra-red detector to set off an alarm when Santa sneaks in to your  room. It's a great introduction to using simple sensors on the Raspberry Pi and can be adapted to lots of different projects.

## What you will need

### Hardware

- A Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian
- A passive infra-red detector (try [eBay](http://search.ebay.co.uk/pir+motion+sensor+module))
- Three female-female header leads

### Software

- Scratch GPIO 5

## Steps

1. Connect the sensor
2. Test the sensor in Scratch
3. Draw a sprite and add sound
4. Program what happens when the detector spots movement
5. Set up the detector in your room!
